# Current Market Data Status

## What's Happening:

1. **Yahoo Finance is being rate limited** - The empty responses indicate Yahoo is blocking requests
2. **Alpha Vantage hit daily limit** - You've used all 25 free requests for today
3. **Too many prefetch tasks** - Multiple services trying to prefetch data simultaneously

## Immediate Solution:

I've disabled the new market data services to get you back to a working state. Your app now uses:
- `/market-live/*` - Your original Yahoo Finance endpoints (with built-in caching)

## Why the New System Failed:

1. **Too aggressive prefetching** - Multiple services fetching 20+ stocks every 2 minutes
2. **Yahoo Finance rate limiting** - They detected automated requests
3. **No backoff strategy** - Kept retrying failed requests

## Recommended Approach:

### For Now (Free):
1. Use your existing Yahoo Finance endpoints
2. They already have 60-second caching built in
3. Don't prefetch - fetch on demand only

### When You're Ready to Scale:
1. Get Polygon.io Starter ($29/month) - It just works, no rate limits
2. Or use Twelve Data ($29/month) - 60,000 requests/day
3. Or use multiple Alpha Vantage keys (rotate between them)

## To Test if Working:

```bash
# Restart backend
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Test endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/market-live/test
```

The frontend is already configured to use `/market-live/followed` which should work fine.

## Key Lessons:

1. Yahoo Finance is free but unreliable at scale
2. Alpha Vantage free tier is too limited (25 req/day)
3. Prefetching without rate limiting causes bans
4. For production, you need a paid service

Your original implementation was actually quite good - it had caching and worked reliably for small scale!
