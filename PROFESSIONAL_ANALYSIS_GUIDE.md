# Professional Equity Analysis Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a complete, professional-grade equity research report system with:
- No cut-off text or incomplete sentences
- Professional research tone with concrete numbers
- Consistent UI with all 6 sections always visible
- Structured JSON output for reliable rendering
- Post-processing validation for content quality

## Key Features

### Backend (`news_professional.py`)

1. **Professional Agent Prompts**
   - Technical Analyst: Specific price levels, indicators (50-DMA at 31.8, RSI 38)
   - Fundamental Analyst: Concrete metrics (Revenue +3% YoY, P/E 18x vs peers 25x)
   - Sentiment Analyst: Time-specific (past 5 days, since Nov 15)
   - Risk Analyst: Measurable risks (FDA decision Jan 15, $2B debt due Q1)
   - Strategy Synthesizer: Monitoring levels (break above 52, 200-DMA at 47.50)

2. **Content Quality Rules**
   - Banned phrases: "promising", "significant potential", "could indicate"
   - Required: Numbers in each section, specific timeframes
   - Max lengths: Overview 55 words, bullets 18 words
   - Post-processing: Remove markdown, ensure periods, validate completeness

3. **Structured Output**
   ```json
   {
     "ticker": "AAPL",
     "sections": {
       "overview": "Two sentence summary...",
       "market_analysis": ["Bullet 1", "Bullet 2"],
       "fundamental_analysis": "One key metric...",
       "sentiment_snapshot": "Recent direction...",
       "risk_assessment": ["Risk 1", "Risk 2", "Risk 3"],
       "strategy_note": ["Note 1", "Note 2"]
     },
     "meta": {
       "generated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
       "key_levels": {
         "50-DMA": 192.50,
         "Support": 185.00,
         "Resistance": 198.00
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Frontend (`MultiAgentPredictorProfessional.jsx`)

1. **Visual Design**
   - Soft neutral background (gray-50/gray-900)
   - Card-based sections with consistent spacing
   - Icon + title for each section
   - Key level chips under Overview
   - Subtle dividers between sections

2. **Report Card Structure**
   - Header: Logo, ticker, timestamp, action menu
   - 6 sections always visible (shows "Not available" if empty)
   - Consistent icon size and alignment
   - Responsive typography with readable line lengths

3. **States**
   - Loading: Skeleton placeholders for each section
   - Error: "Temporarily unavailable" per section
   - Empty: Professional placeholder text

## Integration Steps

### Backend Setup

1. **Add the professional route to your FastAPI app:**
   ```python
   # In app/main.py
   from app.routes import news_professional
   app.include_router(news_professional.router, prefix="/news")
   ```

2. **Ensure environment variables are set:**
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_key  # Optional but recommended
   ```

### Frontend Integration

1. **Update Dashboard.jsx:**
   ```jsx
   import MultiAgentPredictorProfessional from '../components/MultiAgentPredictorProfessional';
   
   // In TABS array:
   { 
     path: "predictor",
     label: "Equity Analysis", 
     icon: Brain, 
     component: <MultiAgentPredictorProfessional />,
     color: "from-emerald-500 to-green-600"
   }
   ```

2. **Component uses existing API endpoint** - no changes needed to API calls

## Content Examples

### Professional Output Examples

**Overview:**
"AAPL trades 2% below 50-DMA resistance at 192. Q4 iPhone demand concerns weigh despite stable 28% operating margins."

**Market Analysis:**
- "Trading 189.50 below 50-DMA resistance at 192.15"
- "RSI 42 approaching oversold, support at 185 October lows"

**Fundamentals:**
"Revenue growth decelerated to 3% YoY in Q3 from 8% prior. Trading at 28x forward P/E, premium to S&P 25x average."

**Sentiment:**
"Sentiment shifted negative past week after Barclays downgrade. Average PT lowered to $210 from $220 among 15 analysts."

**Risk Assessment:**
- "China revenue 20% of total faces regulatory pressure"
- "Services growth deceleration below 15% would impact multiple"
- "March product event expectations may disappoint"

**Strategy Note:**
- "Break above 192 resistance would target 200 psychological level"
- "Q1 earnings Feb 2 key catalyst for guidance clarity"
- "Consider hedges if 185 support fails on heavy volume"

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Checks
1. Each section has content or "Not available"
2. No trailing conjunctions or incomplete sentences
3. At least one number per section where applicable
4. Bullets are complete thoughts (6-18 words)
5. Total overview under 55 words

### Visual Consistency
1. All sections render even with thin data
2. Icons align perfectly with titles
3. Spacing is consistent between sections
4. Key level chips only show when data exists
5. Loading states show realistic skeletons

## Performance

- Parallel processing: 3 tickers simultaneously
- Timeout per ticker: 180 seconds
- Lower temperature (0.3) for consistency
- Smaller token limit (400) for conciseness
- Post-processing adds <100ms per report

## Customization

### To modify agent behavior:
Edit agent backstories in `create_professional_agents()`

### To adjust content length:
Modify max lengths in `post_process_content()`

### To change visual design:
Update Tailwind classes in `ReportSection` and `TickerReportCard`

### To add new sections:
1. Add to SECTIONS array in frontend
2. Create new agent and task in backend
